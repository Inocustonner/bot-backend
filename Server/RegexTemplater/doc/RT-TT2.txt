In general: 
	1. Variables can be used as values for other variables, if variables that use other variables are not present in determinator expression
	For example:
	For the following variables and DE, applying string "Team2" 
	must set |$p to 2| and |$d to 3|
		var $p = (\d)
		var $d = $p ? "1" -> "2": "2" -> "3"
		DE: Team$p
In details: 
	Variables that use others as their values MUST NOT occure in the determinator expression(DE)
	Variables values, probably will be applied after evaluation of those in DE
